      <description>Problem In general blockchain, every single node is required to replicate, validate, store and maintain the states of all users in entire network. Solution This paper present a idea to divide the blockchain into different asynchronous consensus zones (multi-instanitiation of independent blockchain systems). Partitioning workloads of the entire network, distribute to zones. Parallelize blovk creation and transaction handling since we have multi-independent blockchain. To achieve linear scalability as the entire</description>

      <description>Abstract &amp;ldquo;Scaling blockchain systems under general workloads remains an open question&amp;rdquo;. The challenges of scaling are different between databasebases and blockchain since they have different failure models. The major contribution of this paper: Enhance the performance of Byzantine consensus protocols -&amp;gt; inprove the individual shard&amp;rsquo;s throughput. Design an efficient shard formation protocol -&amp;gt; leverage a trsted random beacon to securely assign nodes into shards. Design a general distributed transaction protocol</description>
